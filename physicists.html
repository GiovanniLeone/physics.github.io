          <h2>Albert Einstien</h2>
          <p>Albert Einstein(1879-1955) was a German physicist who developed the
          theory of relativity. He also explained the photoelectric
          effect which won him the nobel prize. Much of the technology
          we use today sych as atomic energy is the result of Einstien.
          He then later developed the equation E = mc(c). In 1931, Einstien
          was targeted by the Nazis and was forced to migrate to the United
          States. He is considered the most influential physicist of the
          20th century.</p>

          <h2>Marie Curie</h2>
          <p>Marie Curie (1867-1934) is the first woman to win a nobel prize in 1903 for
          discovering radioactivity. She then won her second nobel prize in
          1911. In 1934, Curie is killed in a road accident</p>

          <h2>Niels Bohr</h2>
          <p>Niels Bohr(1885-1962), born in Copernhagh, developed the mordern
          structure of the atom. Which has a nucleus at the center with electrons
          revolving around it. Because of this new idea, Bohr won the Nobel Prize
          in 1992. In 1954, eight year before his death, Bohr helped establish
          the European particle physics facility called Cern.</p>

          <h2>Stephen Hawking</h2>
          <p>Stephen Hawking(1942-2018) has defied all emotional, physical and academic
            boundaries. He suffered from a disease called amyotrophic lateral
            sclerosis, a disease that paralyized him. He defied the doctor's prediction of a two
            year life expectancy in 1963. Despite Hawking's disadvantages, he still dedicated
            his life's work to academia and pubilshed A Brief History Of Time. His book that
            discusses his theories of cosmology.</p>
